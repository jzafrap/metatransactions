/** implement metatransactions.
 * 
 * This contract stores a nonceTracker for every approving address. For success, the nonce passed in the sign data must corresponds
 *  to the actual nonce for approving address stored here. After the call, the nonce is incremented.
 * 
 * 1. Entry point is method callViaProxyDelegated(address approvingAddress, address destinationAddress, bytes memory data, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
 * Where:
 *    - approvingAddress: the signer of sign data. Then, the "approver" of this delegated call.
 *    - destinationAddress: contract address that will be called via call() method and passed data 
 *    - data:  encoded data passed to destination in the delegated call. Must refer to an existing method of the destination contract.
 *    - v, r, s: parameters for sign verification. The signer must be approvingAddress for success.
 *  
 * 2. callViaProxyDelegated verifies that the received sign is signed by approvingAddress. Here Applies some verifications, see the code below.
 * 3. If sign verification passes, then the call to the delegated is performed with this line of code:
 *          (bool success, bytes memory _returnData) = destination.call(data);
 *    - Here, destination is the smart contract that has the called method (Vault contract).
 *    - Is important that "data" is correct and corresponds to one of destination smart contrac methods and parameters (abi-encoded).
 * 4. If the delegated call ends with success, the function will return with success.
 * 5. If case of success, returned data is delegated call returned data.
 *
